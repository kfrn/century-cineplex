**_What?_**   
The **Century Cineplex** is a historical movie app that gives you information about the films released in the current month, one hundred years ago.

**_How?_**  
The Century Cineplex allows you to search by country, genre, and the presence of a plot summary. Or, you can ask the app for a random film of the month!   
<sub>(_Note_: To keep it interesting, the random film option is restricted to films that have either a poster or a synopsis).</sub>

**_Why?_**  
When a time machine is finally invented, it seems likely—even certain—that it will work in exact one-hundred-year increments. With this app, movie buffs can be prepared for this eventuality.

**_Where?_**  
Try it out [here](http://century-cineplex.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku!

_Version note:_  
Originally written with inbuilt web-scraping capabilities and database, I've since rewritten the **Century Cineplex** to pull data from my [Cinema 1917 API](https://github.com/kfrn/cinema-1917-api).
